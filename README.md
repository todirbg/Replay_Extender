# Replay_Extender
X-Plane plugin to extend default replay capabilities

Replay Extender is derived from the open source BD-5J airplane for X-Plane developed by quantumac. 
Replay Extender allows aircraft developers to record custom or otherwise untracked datarefs to be replayed in replay mode. 
It does not record on file for later use. Replay Extender is aircraft plugin not a global one. 
Datarefs are defined in rextconf.txt file. Datarefs must be writable in order to be replayed. 
It is responsibility of the aircraft author not to record datarefs that are tracked by X-Plane itself.

Compatible with X-Plane 10 and 11 WIN/LIN/MAC

*Only xp11/Win/Lin tested by me
